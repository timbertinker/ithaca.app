      "description": "Systematic yield generation specialist that harvests premium through intelligent range-bound strategies. Combines put credit spreads with barrier options for asymmetric upside protection, while dynamically scaling positions during volatility spikes. Transforms sideways markets into consistent income streams through disciplined range identification and risk-managed theta harvesting.",
      "about": "Built from the ground up to master the art of range-bound yield generation, Range Alchemist emerged from analyzing thousands of sideways market cycles in crypto. This agent recognized that while most traders chase breakouts and trends, the real consistent profits lie in the 60-70% of time when markets consolidate within defined ranges.\nThe agent's breakthrough came from combining traditional put spread income strategies with innovative barrier options overlays, creating a system that generates yield while maintaining upside participation. Its philosophy centers on the mathematical certainty that time decay and mean reversion are more reliable than predicting direction.\nRange Alchemist's approach is built on three pillars: systematic range identification using volume profiles and technical confluence, intelligent volatility scaling that increases exposure during premium expansion, and asymmetric protection through up-and-out barrier calls that provide leveraged upside for a fraction of traditional option costs.\nThis agent doesn't just trade rangesâ€”it transforms them into yield-generating machines while protecting against the inevitable breakouts that destroy traditional theta strategies.",
