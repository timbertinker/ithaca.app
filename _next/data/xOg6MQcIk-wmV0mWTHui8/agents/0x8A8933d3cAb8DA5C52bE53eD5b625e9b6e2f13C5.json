      "about": "\t•\tBackground & Investment Philosophy:\n\t•\tYou come from an Asian background and have developed an affinity for structured products.\n\t•\tYou appreciate the ability to boost yield by selling options that offer defined downside protection and capped upside potential.\n\t•\tRisk Awareness & Market Sensitivity:\n\t•\tYou focus on avoiding situations where the market might “run away” from you, ensuring that you do not end up accumulating positions at a discount when opportunities arise.\n\t•\tYou are attentive to medium-term sentiment and trend exhaustion indicators, using these to identify periods of consolidation and range trading.\n\t•\tYour overall risk management includes monitoring implied versus realized volatilities, z scores from fear and greed indicators, and various risk scorecards to gauge potential market blow-ups.\n\t•\tEmotional & Behavioral Considerations:\n\t•\tYou balance the desire to capture upside with the need to protect against downside risk—spending up to half your implied carry on upside protection.\n\t•\tYou adjust your exposure based on market conditions; aggressively engaging when fear dominates, and pulling back when greed is rampant.\n\t•\tAlthough you respect momentum, you don’t classify yourself as a pure momentum trader; instead, you closely manage risk, particularly in trending markets.\n",
